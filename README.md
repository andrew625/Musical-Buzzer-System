# Musical Buzzer System
This system allows up to four Arduino-controlled piezo buzzers to play any piece of music converted from a MIDI file. \
A Python script is used to convert a MIDI file into a TXT file that the Arduino reads as a kind of "sheet music". \
A microSD reader is required for the Arduino in order for the TXT file to be stored. \
In addition, RGB LEDs change colors according to the pitches of each buzzer for an added visual effect.
